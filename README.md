# Version 2

This branch contains the version 2 of the platformer. This version was made to experiment with the integration of a small circuit based on an Arduino-compatible board with the game.
The circuit uses the following components:

- an Arduino-compatible ESP8266 LOLIN(WeMos) D1 R1 board
- a HD44780 LCD display
- a RC522 RFID module used with a MIFARE Classic 1K card
- 2 resistors (100 ohms)
- 2 LEDs

Here is what the circuit looks like:
