# Unity-platformer-workshop

A simple Unity platformer made for a practical class with a special focus on game feel and game design. 
The main goal of this class was to produce a good playing experience within the platformer by offering pleasing controls, as well as lively feedbacks for the player (simple special effects, animations, sound effects, etc...).

More explicit directives for this class included:

<ul>
  <li>Implementing our own game physics management and collision detection systems (without using advanced tools provided by Unity).</li>
  <li>Implementing our own controls system for various controllers (without using advanced tools provided by Unity).</li>
  <li>Creating basic feedbacks to make the game more pleasing to play (again, without using tools provided by Unity).</li>
</ul>
