# Unity-platformer-workshop

A simple Unity platformer made for practical classes.

- Branch `v1` (this branch) contains the first version of the game.
- Branch `v2` holds the second version of the game. In this version, I added an Arduino extension to the game, as well as another level to go with it. Check out [this README](../v2#readme) to discover version 2.

- `*-builds` branches contain Windows and WebGL builds for each version of the game.
- The `v1-demo` branch holds a WebGL build of version 1, available for you to play thanks to GitHub pages (link bellow).
- Other branches are unstable/unrelevant development branches.

# Version 1

The first version of the game was made for a course on game feel and game design. <br>
The main goal was to produce a good playing experience within the platformer by offering pleasing controls, as well as lively feedbacks for the player (simple special effects, animations, sound effects, etc...).

More explicit directives for this project included:

<ul>
  <li>Implementing our own game physics management and collision detection systems (without using advanced tools provided by Unity).</li>
  <li>Implementing our own controls system for various controllers (without using advanced tools provided by Unity).</li>
  <li>Creating basic feedbacks to make the game more pleasing to play (again, without using tools provided by Unity).</li>
</ul>

Make sure to check out version 2 [here](../v2#readme) as well!

## Play it!

As mentionned above, you can give version 1 a try [HERE](https://gib-g.github.io/Unity-platformer-workshop/)!

You can control the player (a simple blue cube) with an Xbox One controller or your keyboard. Make sure to check the "Guide" submenu from the main menu for a quick presentation of the controls!
